Planning out Quizzical

Components:

- Splash (isStarted is false)
- Quiz Page (displays if isStarted is true)
	- Quiz questions (isStarted is true)
	- Quiz answers (isStarted is true)

useState:
- SelectedAnswers, could be objects representing question # (or ID?) and selected answer ID
- isGraded
- isStarted
- questions

useEffect:
- may have to use when grading? since we're comparing two states
- pulling in new questions from API

Notes:
- may have to do some useEffect cleanup?
